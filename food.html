                <h2 class="head">We think this is a truly amazing and delicious version of the classic Indian layered rice dish. Our method is close to the traditional way, except we finish ours in the oven rather than on the stovetop. This ensures even heating, which acts as an insurance policy against burning. Save the leftover onion oil – it's very fragrant and flavorful and can be used in other sauces.</h2>
